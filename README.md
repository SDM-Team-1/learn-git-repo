# learn-git-repo
This is a dummy repository to learn git, gitflow and other concepts
Playing with Git 

Adding to file
Is branching working? 
I hope so, lets see!
Testing again
A new play-branch has been created on my local machine however, doesn't work
Some git commands to remember:
git status (shows what is the status)
git add README.md (to add new changes to file)
git commit -m "message" (commits the changes to the repository)

# Some more commands
git checkout -b <new_branch_name> # creates new branch from current branch
